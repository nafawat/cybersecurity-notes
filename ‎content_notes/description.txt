ðŸ”§ Project Summary: Cybersecurity Notes Site with Raspberry Pi & GitHub
You are building a self-hosted cybersecurity notes website using a Raspberry Pi as a lightweight web server and GitHub as the source control and content repository. The site is powered by Hugo (a static site generator) and styled using the PaperMod theme.

ðŸŽ¯ Goals:
Serve a personal cybersecurity knowledge base/blog.

Enable easy version control and updates via GitHub.

Automatically sync and serve updated content from GitHub to the Raspberry Pi.

Provide a clean, fast, and dark-themed interface optimized for technical documentation.

ðŸ§© Key Components:
Raspberry Pi: Acts as the local web server hosting the static website.

GitHub Repo: Stores your Markdown-based cybersecurity notes and Hugo config.

Hugo + PaperMod: Generates a clean, responsive static website from your notes.

Shell Script (sync-and-serve.sh): Automates pulling updates from GitHub and regenerating the site on the Pi.

ðŸ”„ Workflow:
You write/edit your cybersecurity notes in Markdown and push them to GitHub.

Your Raspberry Pi regularly (or manually) runs a script to:

Pull changes from GitHub.

Rebuild the site using Hugo.

Serve the updated site locally or to your network.

Anyone with access to your Piâ€™s IP or domain (if configured) can browse your notes.
